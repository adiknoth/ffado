\brief The Base Class for Ports

 Ports are the entities that provide the interface between the ISO streaming
 layer and the datatype-specific layer. You can define plug types by subclassing
 the base port type.
 
 After creating a port, you have to set its parameters and then call the init() function.
 This is because a port needs information from two sources to operate: 
 1) the stream composition information from the AvDevice
 2) the streaming API setup (buffer type, data type, ...)
 
 \note There are not much virtual functions here because of the high frequency of
       calling. We try to do everything with a base class getter, and a child class
       setter. If this isn't possible, we do a static_cast. This however can only be
       done inside the streamprocessor that handles the specific sub-class types of 
       the ports. i.e. by design you should make sure that the static_cast will be
       OK.
       
 \todo rework the implementation into something more beautifull

	/**
	 * \brief enable/disable ratecontrol
	 *
	 * Rate control is nescessary for some types of ports (most notably 
	 * midi). The StreamProcessor that handles the port should call canRead()
	 * everytime a 'slot' that could be filled with an event passes. The canRead 
	 * function will return true if 
	 *  (1) there is an event ready in the buffer
	 *  (2) we are allowed to send an event in this slot
	 *
	 * Setting the rate works is done with the slot_interval and the event_interval
	 * parameters. On every call to canRead(), a counter is decremented with 
	 * slot_interval. If the counter drops below 0, canRead() returns true and resets
	 * the counter to event_interval.
	 *
	 * e.g. for AMDTP midi, we are only allowed to send a midi byte every 320us
	 *      if the SYT interval is 8, there is exactly one midi slot every packet.
	 *	therefore the slot_interval is 1/8000s (=125us), and the event_interval 
	 *      is 320us.
	 *      
	 *      Note that the interval parameters are unitless, so you can adapt them
	 *      to your needs. In the AMDTP case for example, when the SYT interval is 32
	 *      (when the samplerate is 192kHz for example) there are 4 midi slots in
	 *      each packet, making the slot time interval 125us/4 = 31.25us. 
	 *      The event time interval stays the same (320us). We can however set the
	 *	slot_interval to 3125 and the event_interval to 32000, as we can choose
	 *	the unit of the counter time step (chosen to be 10ns in this case).
	 *
	 * The average argument deserves some attention too. If average is true, we use
	 * average rate control. This means that on average there will be a delay of
	 * event_interval between two events, but that sometimes there can be a smaller
	 * delay. This mode fixes the average rate of the stream.
	 * If average is false, there will always be a minimal delay of event_interval
	 * between two events. This means that the maximum rate of the stream is fixed,
	 * and that the average rate will be lower than (or at max equal to) the rate in 
	 * average mode.
	 *
	 *
	 * \note only works for the E_RingBuffer ports
