Audio data streaming packets
----------------------------

It appears the streaming packets in the "mark 3" devices use a very similar
protocol to the earlier interfaces.  Each iso packet begins with a 64-bit
CIP header.  Following this are N data blocks, where N varies according to
the sample rate selected (8 for 1x, 16 for 2x, 32 for 4x).  Each data block
comprises a 32-bit SPH field (consisting of a standard SPH timestamp), 48
bits of control/MIDI data and then the audio data itself.  The audio data is
sent as packed big-endian signed integer data, as for the earlier
interfaces.

At 1x rates, the maximum packet size sent to the MOTU is 0x328 (808) bytes:
  8 bytes CIP header
  8 data blocks
Each data block contains:
  4 bytes SPH timestamp
  6 bytes control/MIDI data
  90 bytes of audio data (30 channels)
The audio data is ordered as follows: phones, analog 1-8, main out, SPDIF,
ADAT1 1-8, ADAT2 1-8.

At 1x rates the MOTU sends 0x388 (904) bytes per packet, providing space
for 32 audio channels (order to be investigated): mic/guitar 1-2, analog
1-8, return 1-2, reverb 1-2, SPDIF, ADAT1 1-8, ADAT2 1-8.

At 2x rates, packets sent to the MOTU have a maximum size of 0x4c8 (1224)
bytes while those sent by the MOTU are 0x0588 (1416) bytes.  16 blocks are
send in each packet.  22 channels sent to the MOTU (order to be confirmed):
phones, analog 1-8, main out, SPDIF, ADAT1 1-4, ADAT2 1-4.  There is space
for 26 channels sent from the MOTU (order to be investigated): analog 1-8,
mic/guitar 1-2, SPDIF, return 1-2, ADAT1 1-4, ADAT2 1-4, unknown 1-4.

At 4x rates 0x0508 (1288) bytes are sent to the MOTU and 0x0688 (1672) are
sent from the MOTU.  For sending to the MOTU there are 32 blocks with room
for 10 audio channels: unknown 1-2, analog 1-8.  The MOTU sends 14 audio
channels (order to be investigated): analog 1-8, mic/guitar 1-2, return 1-2,
unknown 1-2.


CuemixFX control
----------------

Control of the CuemixFX system is via writes starting at register
0xffff00010000.  Either 1, 2 or 3 quadlets are written depending on what is
being done.  Each packet includes a serial number which is incremented after
sending each control packet.  The same serial number counter is used
regardless of the type of control packet being sent.


CuemixFX heartbeats
-------------------

The MOTU periodically sends a heartbeat packet back to the PC.  This is sent
to address 0x000300000000 and consists of a single quadlet length write
block request of the following form:

  00 aa 00 00

"aa" is the serial number ranging from 0x00 to 0xff.

It appears that heartbeat packets are sometimes sent to the MOTU.  These take
the form of single-quadlet writes to the CuemixFX address.  The quadlet
takes the following form:

  02 aa 00 00

"aa" is the serial number of the packet ranging from 0x00 to 0xff.

It's not yet certain what purpose these packets serve and whether they are
in fact necessary.  It is also not yet known whether the MOTU or the PC
initiates the process (that is, which one sends a packet with a given serial
number first).


Pedal events
------------

When a pedal event occurs the MOTU sends a quadlet write request to address
0x000300000000 on the PC.  The format of the quadlet is as follows.

  bb 00 00 c2

"bb" is 0 for a "pedal up" event and 1 for a "pedal down" event.  The pedal
is "down" when the pedal switch is closed.


CuemixFX variable controls
--------------------------

The control of continuously variable controls (for example, faders, pan
controls) is by way of 3-quadlet writes to the CuemixFX register.  The
format of these writes is as follows:

  02 aa 66 bb - cc dd ee v1 - v2 v3 v4 00

where:
  aa = packet serial number as previously described
  bb = the bus/channel number (0x00 = mix bus 1, mic 1)
  cc-dd-ee = the key of the control being changed
  v1-v4 = the value being written.  v1 is the most-significant byte.  The
          value appears to be a 32-bit float.  That is, v1..v4 is a big
          endian 32-bit float.

Keys presently identified are as follows.

  00-01-02 = Bus reverb send (0-0x3f800000)
  00-0c-01 = Input reverb send (0 ("-inf") to 0x3f800000 ("0 dB")).  bb is
             the zero-based input channel index for this key.
  01-01-02 = Bus reverb return (0-0x3f800000)
  02-00-01 = Input trim control (mic inputs: 0 ("+0 dB") - 0x42540000 ("+53
             dB"); line inputs: 0xc2c00000 ("-96") - 0x41b00000 ("+22")). 
             For this key, bb is the zero-based channel index.
  02-00-02 = Bus master fader
  02-mm-02 = Channel pan.  mm is the standard channel index.  Values range
             from 0xbf800000 (L) to 0x3f800000 (R).
  03-mm-02 = Channel fader.  mm is the channel index starting at 0x02 for
             the first channel (on the 828-mk3 this is mic 1).  Values range
             from 0 (-inf) to 0x3f800000 (0 dB).
  05-mm-02 = Channel balance (active only for stereo paired channels). 
             Values are from 0xbf800000 ("-1") to 0x3f800000 ("1").
  06-mm-02 = Channel width (active only for MS-paired channels).  Values are
             from 0 ("0") to 0x3f800000 ("1").
  07-00-00 = Focus select.  v4 = 0x01 for channel select, 0x03 for bus
             select.  For channel select one is focusing the actual input,
             not the channel in the current bus.  Therefore the bus select
             byte (bb) is always zero for this key. v1 = 0x00 (mic 1 or 2),
             0x01 (ana 1 or 2) and so forth for channel pairs.  Bus focus
             focuses the output assigned to the bus, not the bus itself.  v1
             in this case is 0x00 for Main, 0x01 for Analog 1-2 and so
             forth.  Again the bus select byte is always zero.
             v2 and v3 are always zero.

  03-0a-03 = leveler gain reduction.  Value range 0x00000000 to 0x42c80000.

Channel index values (mm in the above tables) are as follows on the 828 Mk3.

             dB).


CuemixFX switches
-----------------

Switches and discrete controls in CuemixFX are controlled through a
2-quadlet write to the CuemixFX register.  The format of this is

  02 aa 69 v1 - bb k1 k2 k3

where:
  aa = packet serial number
  bb = bus/channel index (0x00 = mix bus 1 or mic 1, depending on the control)
  v1 = the value of the switch / discrete control
  k1-k2-k3 = the key of the control being set

Depending on the control, the channel number being set is communicated
either as part of the key (for controls which operate on a per-mixbus basis)
or in the "bb" field of the packet (for controls which operate on a
per-input/output basis.

The keys appear to be rather structured.  The value of k3 appears to
indicate what kind of object the key applies to:

  00 = global resource (eg: talkback)
  01 = input channel (corresponding to a physical device input)
  02 = a channel in a bus mix
  03 = output channel (corresponding to a physical device output)
  04 = global configuration

Keys presently identified:
  00-00-01 = Input channel phase.  Value is 0x00 (normal), 0x01 (invert)
             bb is the input channel index (0 is mic 1).  When two adjacent
             channels are paired the phase of each can still be independently 
             controlled.  FIXME: also under the 00-cc-01 entry.
  00-00-02 = bus output assignment.  Values are:
              0xff = disabled
              0x00 = main L-R
              0x01-0x04 = Analog 1-2 though 7-8
              0x05 = SPDIF 1-2
              0x06 = Phones L-R
              0x07-0x0a = ADAT A 1-2 through 7-8
              0x0b-0x0e = ADAT B 1-2 through 7-8
  00-03-00 = talkback channel select.  The value is the 0-based channel index
             of the talkback channel.
  00-cc-01 = input channel EQ/dynamics switches.  Value is 0x00 (off) or 0x01
             (on).  cc values identified to date:
               00 = phase (0x00 normal, 0x01 invert)
               02 = EQ F enable

               05 = EQ D enable
               06 = EQ E enable
               07 = EQ B enable
               08 = EQ G enable
               0a = Compressor enable
               0b = Leveler enable
             FIXME: work out some way to identify the EQs.
  00-cc-03 = output channel EQ/dynamics switches.  Value is 0x00 (off) or
             0x01 (on).  cc values identified to date:
               01 = EQ F enable
               02 = EQ A enable
               03 = EQ C enable
               04 = EQ D enable

               06 = EQ B enable
               07 = EQ G enable
               09 = Compressor enable
               0a = Leveler enable
  00-04-00 = talkback listen channel select.  The value is the 0-based
             channel index of the talkback listen channel.
  00-mm-02 = mix channel mute.  mm is the channel index as for other keys. 
             Value is 0x00 (off) or 0x01 (on).

  00-0c-03 = output channel monitor enable (0x00=off, 0x01=on)
  01-00-01 = input channel mono/stereo mode.  Value is 0x00 (mono), 0x01
             (stereo).  bb (bus select byte) is always zero for this key
             since this acts globally on the input.
  01-00-04 = Reverb split point.  Value is 0x00 for "mixes", 0x01 for
             "outputs".
  01-mm-02 = mix channel solo.  mm is as for the mute control.  Value is
             0x00 (off) or 0x01 (on).
  01-0a-03 = output channel leveler mode (0x00=compress, 0x01=limit)
  01-0c-03 = output channel talkback talk (0x00=off, 0x01=on)
  02-0c-03 = output channel talkback listen (0x00=off, 0x01=on)
  03-00-01 = input channel swap L and R.  Value is 0x00 (no swap), 0x01
             (swap).  bb is the input channel index.
  04-00-01 = input channel stereo mode.  Value is 0x00 for normal stereo,
             0x01 for MS.  Relevant only if input channel is in stereo mode
             (and thus part of a stereo pair).
  06-00-01 = input channel Vlimit on (mic channels only).  Values are 0x00
             (off), 0x01 (on).
  06-0a-01 = input channel compressor mode (0x00=peak, 0x01=RMS)
  06-0b-01 = input channel leveler mode (0x00=compress, 0x01=limit)
  06-09-03 = output channel compressor mode (0x00=peak, 0x01=RMS)
  07-00-01 = input channel Vlimit lookahead (mic channels only).  Values are 
             0x00 (off), 0x01 (on).
  08-00-01 = input channel soft clip (mic channels only).  Values are 0x00 
             (off), 0x01 (on).
  0c-00-04 = Reverb early reflections model.  Value is 0x00-0x04 for "Room
             A" through to "Room E".  bb is zero.
