RME Fireface-400 / Fireface-800 register map
============================================

Version: 0.25

Definitions
-----------

CBA = Command Buffer Address
FF800 = Fireface-800
FF400 = Fireface-400

Multi-byte values sent to/from the Fireface in async packets are generally
little endian - that is, the device interprets quadlets in asynchronous
packets as little endian even though the bus definition is big-endian.  If
writing a driver for use on a little endian machine, this means that a lack
of byte swapping (to account for the bus endianness standard) will cause bit
0 on the host to be bit 0 on the device.

By default, FFADO however adheres to the bus standards and byteswaps on
little endian machines.  Under this regime, bit 0 on the host will in fact
be read by the device as the least significant bit in the most significant
byte.

In order to retain consistency with device documentation, the FFADO RME
driver currently sends async packet data in the little endian format which
the RME device expects.  Although this is technically wrong (in so far as
the Firewire standard is concerned), at this stage it is considered that
introducing an endianness difference between the FFADO driver and the
documentation is likely to result in maintenance issues down the track.

The bit maps in this document regarding the configuration registers are
written from the device's point of view.  That is, the values quoted should
be sent to the device in little endian format unless otherwise stated.

Curiously enough, preliminary investigations suggest that audio data appears
to be sent on the bus in big endian format (although this is to be
confirmed).

The FF800 includes a number of instrument options for input 1 which are
described using several different terms interchangeably:
 - "Drive" (also referred to as "fuzz") activates 25 dB extra gain
 - "Speaker emulation" (also referred to as "filter") removes LF noise and
   some HF
 - "Limiter" activates a soft-limiter with a threshold of -10 dBFS.  This
   can only be switched off if the Front input is used for channel 1.


Device address space location
-----------------------------

While some register addresses are common between the two interfaces, the
absolute addresses of the settings and control differ.  These are defined
relative to the device "command buffer" address:

  FF800: command buffer address (CBA) = 0xfc88f000
  FF400: command buffer address (CBA) = 0x80100500

The location of the configuration (settings) registers relative to the
command buffer is consistent across devices:

  conf reg 1 address = command buffer address + 5*4

For a FF800 this equates to 0xfc88f014.


Controlling sample rate (DDS)
-----------------------------

Sample rate is controlled by writing the desired sample rate in Hz to the
sample rate control register located at offset 0 from the command buffer
address (0xfc88f000 on a FF800).  The hardware DDS allows a wide range of
frequencies to be requested (possibly anything from 30 kHz up to 210 kHz).
The more common rates are of course 32k, 44.1k, 48k, the pull-up/down rates
(44.056k, 44.144k, 45.937k, 46.080k, 47.952k, 48.048k) and the corresponding
2x and 4x rates.

Software connecting to the Fireface device is restricted to the normal rates
of 32k, 44.1k, 48k and the related 2x and 4x rates.

If the device is in master clock mode and the user has not made an explicit
DDS setting, the hardware DDS will be determined by the sampling rate
requested by the application opening the device.  If a DDS frequency has
been requested by the user the actual rate used by the device will be that
DDS frequency regardless of what the application has asked for.  In this
case a device open will only succeed if the software has requested a speed
whose multiplier matches the DDS configuration.

If the device is locked to an external clock, a device open will succeed
only if the multiplier of the requested sampling rate matches that of the
external rate.

The device status registers allow the PC to determine the sampling rate when
an external clock is in use.  However, there is no way to read the sampling
rate when in master clock mode.  It is therefore necessary to cache this in
the driver so it can be provided when requested.

In terms of multipliers the RME treats sample rates greater than 112000 Hz
as 4x rates, with rates greater than 56000 Hz as 2x rates.  Rates less than
30000 Hz and greater than 210000 Hz are invalid.


Configuration registers 1, 2 and 3
----------------------------------

Most RME device configuration is done using configuration registers 1, 2
and 3.  For the ff800 these are:

  config1 = configuration register 1 (FF800: 0xfc88f014, FF400: 0x80100514)
  config2 = configuration register 2 (FF800: 0xfc88f018, FF400: 0x80100518)
  config3 = configuration register 3 (FF800: 0xfc88f01c, FF400: 0x8010051c)

In essence the configuration registers start at CBA+5*4 for both interfaces.

When making a configuration change these registers are always written in a
block of 12 bytes starting at 0xfc88f014 with a block write operation.

Configuration register 1 (FF800: 0xfc88f014, FF400: 0x80100514):

  bits 1-0: Input level control (part 2 of 2: CPLD function):
    00 = lo-gain
    01 = undefined
    10 = +4dBU
    11 = -10dbV

Configuration register 3 (FF800: 0xfc88f01c, FF400: 0x8010051c):
  bit 31: "Drop and stop": always set to 1
  bit 30: Unit option: TMS (active = 1)

  bit 2: Freq1 control (set to 1)
  bit 1: Freq0 control (set to 1)
  bit 0: Clock mode: 0 = Master, 1 = Autosync

On the FF400, writing to these registers with valid values for the first
time after power up has the side effect of extingishing the "Host" LED.


Device status registers
-----------------------

There are up to 4 read-only device status registers available, starting at
address 0x801c0000.  There seems to be a slight difference in the mapping of
status register 0 depending on the size of the read.  If only 2 registers
(quadlets) are read the "general" layout is assumed.  If on the other hand 4
registers are used (used when determining the status of the device's
streaming system) the layout of register 0 is slightly different.

Status register 0:
  bits 9-0: on a 2-quadlet read these bits are all zero
  bits 9-0: on a 4-quadlet read when in autosync mode, these bits contain
            SR/250, where SR is the sample rate to be passed to the
            streaming subsystem when starting streaming.
  bit 10: ADAT1 lock achieved
  bit 11: ADAT2 lock achieved
  bit 12: Device is synced to ADAT1
  bit 13: Device is synced to ADAT2
  bits 17-14: SPDIF frequency:
    0000 = undefined    0101 = 88.2k
    0001 = 32k          0110 = 96k
    0010 = 44.1k        0111 = 128k
    0011 = 48k          1000 = 176.4k
    0100 = 64k          1001 = 192k
  bit 18: Device is synced to SPDIF
  bit 19: Over detected
  bit 20: SPDIF lock achieved
  bit 21: undefined (read as zero)
  bits 24-22: Primary sync source:
    000 = ADAT1         100 = Word clock
    001 = ADAT2         101 = TCO
    011 = SPDIF
  bits 28-25: autosync (external) frequency (defined as for SPDIF frequency)
  bit 29: Device is synced to word clock
  bit 30: Word clock lock achieved
  bit 31: undefined (read as zero)

Status register 1:
  bit 0: master clock mode active
  bits 21-1: undefined
  bit 22: Device is synced to TCO
  bit 23: TCO lock achieved
  bits 31-24: undefined

Status register 2:
  bits 31-0: (FF800 only) firewire iso channel used for data from FF800 to PC

Status register 3:
  bits 31-0: unused


Interfacing to device flash
---------------------------

To preserve the device's settings across power cycles the settings are
stored in a flash memory on the device.  This is read during driver
initialisation to ensure the driver's status agrees with that of the device.

There are several classes of things stored in flash: operational settings,
volumes (ie: the mixer status) and configuration/firmware.  Device settings
start at address 0x3000f0000 on the FF800 and 0x00060000 on the FF400; mixer
data starts at 0x3000e0000 on the FF800 and 0x00070000 on the
FF400.


Reading blocks from the flash (flash command 0x2)

For the FF800 the entire buffer is read directly from flash as a single
block if the block is less than a sector (256 bytes, 64 quadlets).  Polling
for "device not busy" should commence after a wait of 5 ms.  For anything
larger, writes are split into sector-sized sub-blocks.

For the FF400, the buffer is read in 32-quadlet sub-blocks.  A partial block
is read at the end if the total buffer size is not a multiple of
32-quadlets.  To read a sub-block, the address is placed in register
0x80100288 and the sub-block size (in bytes) in 0x8010028c.  A 0x02 is
then written to CBA+(8*4) to initiate the read.  Polling for "device not
busy" should commence after a wait of 2 ms.  Once not busy the data is
available for reading from 0x80100290.


Writing blocks to the flash (flash command 1)

For the FF800, the buffer is written to flash in 256-byte (64 quadlet)
sectors.  Polling for "device not busy" should commence after a wait of 5
ms.  A write request for a length less than a sector will be honoured by the
device (this is done when writing device settings).

For the FF400, the buffer is written in 32-quadlet (128-byte) sub-blocks via
a bounce buffer.  If the final sub-block is not 32-quadlets the write is
only as big as the sub-block (that is, no padding takes place).  The
sub-block data to be written is sent to the block starting at 0x80100290. 
The 2-quadlet register at 0x80100288 is set with the flash address to write
the block to and the size (in bytes) of the data block.  Finally, a 0x1 is
written to CBA+(8*4) to initiate the write.  Polling for "device not busy"
should commence after a wait of 2 ms.


Getting other data from flash

There are a few other commands issued to the flash memory system for
obtaining data about the connected interface:

 * Device revision

   On the FF800 this is read directly from register 0x200000100.

   On the FF400, 0xf is written to CBA+(8*4).  Poll for "not busy" after a
   wait of 2ms.  Once not busy the revision is read from register
   0x80100290.


Erasing the flash

The flash is divided into sections and it is possible to erase each section
separately.  Therefore one only has to erase section of interest when
changing something.

On the FF400, erasure is controlled by writing a special magic number to
the the flash control register (CBA+8*4):
  Erase volume: write 0xe
  Erase settings: write 0xd
  Erase configuration (firmware): write 0xc

On the FF800, erasing is controlled by writing 0 to the applicable register:
  Erase volume: register is 0x3fffffff4
  Erase settings: register is 0x3fffffff0
  Erase firmware: register is 0x3fffffff8
  Erase configuration: register is 0x3fffffffc

It's not clear what the distinction between "configuration" and "firmware"
is.  The FF400 appears to only support "configuration" but treats this as
"firmware".  The FF800 supports both as distinct options.

After issuing the erase command one should wait for 500 ms before polling
the device for the "not busy" status.


Waiting for flash

When interacting with the device's flash memory one must wait for the
completion of an operation before attempting another.  The location of the
"device busy" flag differs between the FF400 and FF800.

On the FF800 is part of the quadlet register at 0x801c0004 (part of the
read-only status register block beginning at 0x801c0000).  The device is
ready to accept another command when bit 30 is set.

On the FF400 the wait state is found by reading a quadlet from CBA+8*4.
If this quadlet is zero the FF400 is ready to accept another command.

Most device flash operations have a minimum time to complete.  There's no
point in polling the device busy flag until at least this much time has
elapsed.


Device settings format
----------------------

The device settings are stored in flash as an array of 59 32-bit unsigned
integers.  These are:

 37 Instrument - FF400: unused
                 FF800: Channel 1 front/rear selector (0=rear, 1=front,

 50 - p12db_an[1-9]

"-" = elements not used (under MacOSX at least)

Total size: 59 quadlets

The default state of these quadlets is 0xffffffff, which is taken to
indicate that the respective setting has not been written to flash. This in
turn causes the driver to assume its own default value.  While these
settings can be changed in real time by writing to the relevant control
registers, these are not persistent across device power cycles.  To make
them persistent it is necessary to store them into the flash.


Flash mixer settings layout
---------------------------

Mixer (volume) data starts at 0x3000e0000 on the FF800 and 0x00070000 on the
FF400.  There are several control groups in the mixer:
  0xe0000 (FF800): "mixer shadow", FF800 only
  0xe2000 (FF800) / 0x70000 (FF400), 0x0800 bytes: 16-bit volume array
  0xe2800 (FF800) / 0x70800 (FF400), 0x0800 bytes: 16-bit pan array
  0xe3000 (FF800) / 0x71000 (FF400), 0x0040 bytes: 16-bit "vol3" array + 
    "enable MIDI control" + "submix" + zero padding to 64 quadlets

All group allocations are written in their entirety (that is, 0x0800 bytes),
with zero padding on the end as needed.  Each write is grouped in sectors,
with each sector being 256 bytes (64 quadlets).

It is not known why the "mixer shadow" is stored in the case of the FF800. 
It comprises a copy of the 32-bit matrix mixer settings (see "Fireface-800
mixer controls" below), and the information is essentially a duplicate of
what's in the "volume" and "pan" arrays.  In any case, what's done is done.

The "mixer shadow" values are written in 64-quadlet (256-byte) blocks, one
per hardware output channel.  There are 28 hardware input/output channels on
the FF800 and 18 for the FF400 (although the FF400 doesn't write a "mixer
shadow" group).

The "volume" and "pan" arrays are arranged in blocks of N (32 for FF800, 18
for FF400) 16-bit elements.  Each block contains the volume/pan value for
each of the N physical inputs or playbacks when sent to one of the N/2
physical stereo output pairs.  Elements are ordered in the standard Fireface
channel index order.  The arrangement of the blocks are as follows:

  Inputs 1..N to output pair 1+2
  Playbacks 1..N to output pair 1+2
  Inputs 1..N to output pair 3+4
  Playbacks 1..N to output pair 3+4
  :
  Inputs 1..N to output pair N/2-1 and N/2
  Playbacks 1..N to output pair N/2-1 and N/2

The "vol3" array represents the hardware output volume settings.  The 16-bit
volume data for each of the N hardware output channels is included in the
standard Fireface channel index order.  In addition, a boolean indicating
whether MIDI control is enabled is stored in zero-based array index 30 while
a submix index is stored in array index 31 (array elements are considered
16-bit here).  The meaning of the submix index isn't known; it's thought
that the GUI mixer applications in other systems use this as a convenient
place to store the submix index that the user was last editting (assuming
they were editting in submix mode).

All 16-bit values are written in little endian byte order.

The "volume" and "vol3" values are unsigned 16-bit values:
  0x0000 = -inf  (minimum)
  0x0255 = -6 dB
  0x0323 =  0 dB
  0x03ff =  6 dB (maximum)

When panned hard left or right, the value F written to the flash as a
channel's volume given a fader value of V (0..0x10000) appears to be:

  F = (1023.0/3) * ln( V*(exp(3)-1)/65536 + 1)

F is rounded to the nearest integer value.

The "pan" values are unsigned 16-bit values.  0x0000 is hard left, 0x0080 is
centre and 0x0100 is hard right.  Therefore if the pan value is represented
as a floating point number Pf from 0.0 (hard left) to 1.0 (hard right), the
pan value Pv written to flash will be

  Pv = 0x0100 * Pf

In the hardware, each channel of a stereo pair is controlled independently
the mixer registers.  It is therefore necessary to convert bidirectionally
between fader value pairs and the volume/pan pair as used in the flash.  Let
V0 and V1 be the fader value (0..0x10000) for each of the two channels.  The
volume (V) and pan (P) values can be calculated as follows.

   V = V0 + V1

  Pf = V1 / (V0 + V1)

   P = 0x0100 * Pf

V is then transformed into the equivalent flash value F according to
the expression given previously:

  F = (1023.0/3) * ln( V*(exp(3)-1)/65536 + 1)

When starting with the volume/pan pair, V is first calculated from F by
rearranging the above equation.  Pf is then calculated:

  Pf = P / 0x100

This allows V0 and V1 to be found:

  V0 = V * (1 - Pf)

  V1 = V * Pf

Careful attention to round-off is required to ensure that flash and fader
values remain unchanged through fader-flash-fader and flash-fader-flash
round trips.

User interfaces under other operating systems include a "pan law" control
which sets the gain when panned to centre.  This setting is not sent to the
device at any time; the default in the mixer software is -6 dB.  Other
options are -4.5 dB, -3 dB and 0 dB.  Changing these affects the values sent
to the individual mixer registers (and hense the "mixer shadow"), but not
the values stored in the "volume" and "pan" flash arrays.  In the case of
the FF400, the power on state obtained from flash is therefore independent
of the pan law control (the FF800 stores the mixer shadow data and could
make use of it if it wanted to).  Experimentation shows that when powering
up, the FF400 assumes a pan law of -6 dB when mapping from the volume/pan
flash arrays to individual mixer element registers.  Tests are still to be
done on the FF800 to see if it uses the "mixer shadow" values instead of the
volume/pan arrays.


TCO (TimeCode Option)
---------------------

The TCO is an optional card for the FF800 which adds video timecode
generation and clock locking capabilities to the FF800.  It is controlled by
writing a block of 4 quadlets to register 0x810f0020 while its status can be
retrieved by reading a block of 4 quadlets from register 0x801f0000.

The configuration space is as follows.

Quadlet 0 (written to register 0x810f0020):
  bit 31: MTC active if set to 1
  bits 30-0: reserved (equal zero)

Quadlet 1 (written to register 0x810f0024):
  bits 31-12: reserved (equal to zero)
  bits 11-10: LTC format (00=24fps, 01=25fps, 10=29.97fps, 11=30fps)
  bit 9: dropframe active
  bit 8: set timecode request
  bit 7: reserved (set to 0)
  bit 6: PAL format video input
  bit 5: NTSC format video input
  bit 4-3: reserved (set to 0)
  bits 2-1: word clock input rate (00=1x, 01=2x, 10=4x)
  bit 0: reserved (set to 0)

Quadlet 2 (written to register 0x810f0028):
  bit 31: set sampling frequency from application
  bits 30-29: input select (00=wordclock, 01=video, 10=LTC)
  bit 28: input termination active
  bit 27: Base frequency (0=44.1 kHz, 1=48 kHz)
  bit 26: Pull up flag
  bit 25: Pull down flag
  bit 24: Pull up/down amount (0=0.1%, 1=4.0%)
  bit 23: reserved (set to 0)
  bit 22: Flywheel select
  bit 21: Jam sync select
  bits 20-19: dropframes select (unused, set to 0)
  bits 18-17: word clock conversion (00=1:1, 01=44.1->48, 10=48->44.1)
  bit 16: set TC run
  bits 15-0: reserved, set to 0.

Quadlet 3:
  bits 31-0: reserved, set to 0

The 4 quadlets returned by a TCO status query are mapped as follows.

Quadlet 0:
  bit 31: set to 1
  bits 30-24: LTC, hours field in BCD(*)
  bit 23: set to 1
  bits 22-16: LTC, minutes field in BCD
  bit 15: set to 1
  bits 14-8: LTC, seconds field in BCD
  bit 7: set to 1
  bits 6-0: LTC, frames field in BCD

Quadlet 1:
  bit 31: set to 1
  bits 30-24: reserved (equal to zero)
  bit 23: set to 1
  bits 22-16: reserved (equal to zero)
  bit 15: set to 1
  bits 14-12: reserved (equal to zero)
  bits 11-10: LTC format (00=24fps, 01=25fps, 10=29.97fps, 11=30fps)
  bit 9: dropframe active
  bit 8: reserved (read as zeros)
  bit 7: set to 1
  bit 6: PAL format video input
  bit 5: NTSC format video input
  bit 4: Word clock input valid (0=invalid, 1=valid)
  bit 3: LTC input valid (0=invalid, 1=valid)
  bits 2-1: reserved (read as zeros)
  bit 0: TCO lock flag (0=no lock, 1=locked)

Quadlet 2
  bit 31: set to 1
  bits 30-24: reserved (equal to zero)
  bit 23: set to 1
  bits 22-16: reserved (equal to zero)
  bit 15: set to 1
  bits 14-8: upper 7 bits of PLL phase
  bit 7: set to 1
  bits 6-0: the lower 7 bits of the PLL phase

Quadlet 3:
  bit 31: set to 1
  bits 30-16: reserved
  bit 15: set to 1
  bits 14-0: set to 0

Notes:
 (*) BCD is Binary Coded Decimal.  The high nibble (which is only 3 bits in
     these cases) contains the "tens" digit while the lower nibble contains
     the "units" digit.

The calculation of the PLL phase from quadlet 2 (q2) is as follows:

  phase = (q2 & 0x7f) + ((q2 & 0x7f00) >> 1)

which then allows the incoming frequency to be calculated using

  freq = (25000000 * 16) / phase

To detect the presence of a TCO in a FF800, read the 4 TCO status quadlets. 
If a TCO is present:
  - bits 31, 23, 15 and 7 in quadlets 0, 1 and 2 will be 1, AND
  - bits 31 and 15 in quadlet 3 will be 1, AND
  - bits 14 to 0 in quadlet 3 will be 0


Streaming control registers
---------------------------

There appears to be a number of registers involved in the setup of device
streaming.

Device (streaming) initialisation register (FF800: 0x20000001c, FF400: CBA)

This register comprises the 3 quadlets starting at address 0x20000001c on
the FF800 and the 5 quadlets starting at the CBA on the FF400.  The first 
quadlet contains the sample rate in Hz.  The second quadlet is mapped as 
follows:
  bits 31-11 = number of audio channels
  bits 10-0  = iso tx channel (PC to interface)
In all local tests with a FF800 the value of this quadlet was always equal
to 0x0000e000 (28 channels, PC transmits on iso channel 0).

The third quadlet is mapped as follows.
  bits 10-0 = number of audio channels
  bit 11    = speed flag; set to 1 if firewire bus is at 800 Mbps
In local tests with a FF800 the value of this register was always 0x0000001c
(28 channels, 400 Mbps firewire bus).

The forth and fifth quadlets (used only by the FF400) are zero.

After this register is configured, 4 quadlets are read starting from
0x801c0000.  When read, these are the device status registers.

Device (streaming) start register (FF800: 0x200000028, FF400: CBA+0x0c):

The start of streaming differs between the FF400 and FF800 in more than just
the address of the relevant register.  On the FF800 this register is mapped
as follows:
  bits 10-0 = number of audio channels
  bit 11    = bus speed flag; set to 1 if firewire bus is at 800 Mbps
On a FF400 the register is as follows:
  bits 4-0  = number of audio channels
  bits 9-5  = iso tx channel (PC to interface)
During initial testing with a FF800 the value of this register was always 
0x0000001c (28 audio channels, PC tx on iso channel 0).

Channel mute setup register (write to 0x801c0000):

After writing to the streaming start register, 0x70 bytes (28 quadlets) are
written starting at 0x801c0000.  Each quadlet represents one channel on the
Fireface800.  A value of 1 mutes the respective channel - indeed on closing
down streaming each quadlet is set to 1.  During startup some values are set
to zero - the ones set to zero may be determined by the channels which have
active software data sources although this is yet to be confirmed with more
testing.  Irrespective of the setting of these registers it appears that
data for all channels is always sent to/from the Fireface-800.

Note that when register 0x801c0000 is read it functions as the device status
register.  It is read during streaming setup, but obviously it bears no
relationship to the channel mute status.

Streaming end register (FF800: 0x200000034, FF400: CBA+0x4):

On the FF800, streaming is stopped by writing 3 zeroed quadlets to
consecutive registers starting at address 0x200000034.  For the FF400 one
writes 3 zeroed quadlets to consecutive registers from CBA+0x4, followed
by a 0x00000001 to CBA+0x10 (making a 4-quadlet write in total).


Iso data
--------

Audio/midi data is sent and received on isochronous channels previously
configured by the driver.  On a dedicated bus with nothing else present, the
stream to the fireface is sent on iso channel 0 while data from the fireface
is sent on iso channel 1.

No CIP header is included in the iso data packet.  Fireface data follows
immediately after the standard 2-quadlet firewire iso packet header.

Each iso packet contains a number of samples across all 28 device channels
(18 channels in the case of the ff400).  For 1x rates, 7 samples per channel
seem to be sent.  Thus the size of the data portion of a 1x iso packet is
28*4*7 = 784, with a total packet size being 784 + 8 = 792.

The data is sent with one audio channel per quadlet.  The audio data is a 24
bit integer stored in the most-significant 3 bytes of a quadlet.  The LSB
(low byte) of certain channels in the stream sent by the Fireface is used to
send synchronising information:

  Low byte of channel 6 = current frame
  Low byte of channel 7 = phase
  Low byte of channel 1 = rx sample counter, low byte
  Low byte of channel 4 = rx sample counter, high byte
  Low byte of channel 0 = tx buffer size, low byte
  Low byte of channel 5 = tx buffer size, high byte
  Low byte of channel 2 & 3 = unknown (midi?)

The low byte data from channels 0-7 is repeated in channels 8-15 and 16-23
respectively, with channels 24-27 containing the low byte data from channels
0-3.  This repetition holds for the low bytes of channels 2-3 in all data
seen so far, it might not necessarily be the case in general - it depends
what the low byte data from channels 2 and 3 are used for.

The rx sample counter appears to be used to detect missed samples.  The
current frame and phase from a received packet is used in conjunction with
the stored values of these from the previous frame to track the phase of
the audio clock.

A "frame" consists of a fixed number of samples across all channels of the
device.  At 1x rates this appears to be 7, but it might not be fixed.  Even
though this is the same as the number of samples per channel per packet, a
given packet can experience a change in the "current frame" part way
through.  In other words, the "current frame" is not necessarily constant
for all samples in a packet.

With the number of samples per channel contained in each iso packet it is
not necessary for the RME to send audio data in every iso cycle.  When it is
deemed that a cycle can be skipped the RME simply doesn't send any packet at
all in that cycle.  This contrasts with other devices which tend to send
empty "placeholder" packets when the need arises.  This means that a cycle
without a packet from the RME is not necessarily an error condition.  To
detect dropped packets one must instead rely on the rx sample counter
embedded in the audio data stream.


Input preamp / output amp gain control
--------------------------------------

On the Fireface-400 the gain of the mic/instrument preamps and output
amplifiers can be set.  Mic channel gain is in steps of 1 dB from 10 dB up to
65 dB, with 0dB also available.  Instrument input gain ranges from 0 dB to
18 dB in 0.5 dB steps.  Output gains range from +6 dB down to -53 dB (a 58
dB range) in steps of 1 dB, with compete "mute" also available.

The gains are set using the register at 0x801c0180.

  bits 31-24: unknown (set to 0)
  bits 23-16: channel being set (see below)
  bits 15-8: unknown (set to 0)
  bits 7-0: the gain value

For mic channels the gain value is the dB value.  For instrument channels, a
value of 2G is written for a gain value of G (thereby allowing a stepsize of
0.5 dB).  For output gain, 0 = +6 dB, 0x3b = -53 dB, 0x3f = mute.

The definition of the "channel being set" is as follows.
  0 = mic input 1 gain
  1 = mic input 2 gain
  2 = instrument input 3 gain
  3 = instrument input 4 gain
  4-9 = analog outputs 1-6 level
  10-11 = phones output level
  12-13 = SPDIF output level
  14-21 = ADAT outputs 1-8 level


Firefice-400 mixer controls
---------------------------

The Fireface-400 matrix mixer is controlled using a block of registers
starting at 0x80080000.  An 18x18 matrix mixer is implemented allowing any
hardware input to be sent to any device output.  Pan control is effected by
manipulating the "left/right" controls within an output pair.

For each input channel block the order of channels is Analog 1-8, SPDIF 1-2,
ADAT 1-8.

0x80080000 - 0x80080044: input channel sends to Analog 1 output.
0x80080048 - 0x8008008c: playback channel sends to Analog 1 output.
0x80080090 - 0x800800d4: input channel sends to Analog 2 output.
0x800800d8 - 0x8008011c: playback channel sends to Analog 2 output.
:
0x80080990 - 0x800809d4: input channel sends to ADAT 8 output.
0x800809d8 - 0x80080a1c: playback channel sends to ADAT 8 output.

0x80080f80: matrix mixer analog 1 output fader
0x80080f84: matrix mixer analog 2 output fader 
:
0x80080fc4: matrix mixer ADAT 8 output fader

Each fader control ranges from 0x00000000 (-inf) through 0x00008000 (0.0 dB)
up to a maximum of 0x00010000 (+6.0 dB).  -52.7 dB appears to correspond to
a value of 0x0000004c, -46.6 dB is 0x00000099.  From this we can see that if
v is the value being written, the dB gain applied can be found using

  dB = 20.log10(v/32768)

Alternatively, to set the gain to G dB, one calculates the value to send to
the device (v) using

  v = 32768 * exp10(G/20)

When setting the output fader controls, the associated output amplifier 
gain control (see previous section) are generally kept in sync.  That is, if
register 0x80080f80 (analog 1 output fader) is set to 0 dB, so is the analog
output 1 level via register 0x801c0180.


Fireface-800 mixer controls
---------------------------

The matrix mixer on the Fireface-800 is controlled using a block of
registers starting at 0x80080000.  A 28x28 matrix mixer is implemented
allowing any device input to be sent to any device output.  The pan controls
are synthesised by manipulating the "left/right" controls.

In each sub-block, the order of channels is in fireface numeric order.  That
is, Analog 1-10, SPDIF, ADAT1 1-8, ADAT2 1-8.

0x80080000 - 0x8008006c: input channel sends to Analog 1 output.
0x80080080 - 0x800800ec: playback channel sends to Analog 1 output.
0x80080100 - 0x8008016c: input channel sends to Analog 2 output.
0x80080180 - 0x800801ec: playback channel sends to Analog 2 output.
:
0x80081b00 - 0x80081b6c: input channel sends to ADAT2-8 output.
0x80081b80 - 0x80081bec: playback channel sends to ADAT2-8 output.

0x80081f80: matrix mixer analog 1 output fader
0x80081f84: matrix mixer analog 2 output fader
:
0x80081fec: maxtrix mixer ADAT2-8 output fader

Each fader control ranges from 0x00000000 (-inf) through 0x00008000 (0.0 dB)
and up to a maximum setting of 0x00010000 (+6.0 dB).  As for the
Fireface-400, if v is the value being written, the dB gain applied can be
found using

  dB = 20.log(v/32768)

Mute is synthesised by setting the respective send value to -inf (0). 
Conversely, solo is synthesised by muting all sends to the selected bus
except the send being soloed.

Note that a different scale is used when writing mixer settings into flash.
Refer to the "Flash mixer settings layout" section for further details.


Metering values
---------------

The Fireface-800 appears to provide hardware support for metering.  The RME
mixer application periodically sends block read requests for register
0x80100000 with a size of 0x3f8.  What is returned is a set of two
datablocks with data in little-endian (least significant bit/word first)
format.  The first block contains arrays of 64-bit floating point numbers
representing channel amplitude with decay, presumedly useful for metering
display.  Arrays are:

  28-element array for input channel amplitude with decay
  28-element array for playback amplitudes with decay (educated guess)
  28-element array for output amplitudes with decay

The second data block contains signed 32 bit integers representing the input
amplitudes without decay.  Valid range is 0 - 0x7ffffff.  Again there are 3
arrays:

  28-element array for input channel ampltude
  28-element array for playback amplitudes (educated guess)
  28-element array for output amplitudes

At the end of this second block are two zero quadlets.  Their purpose is
unknown at this stage.

In each 28-element array the channel data appears in standard fireface
order.


Host LED
--------

The "host" LED of the FF800 is controlled by a dedicated register at
0x200000324.  Note that this register address goes beyond the 32-bit
boundary.

On the FF400 the host LED is controlled internally.  On power up it is
turned on.  Once the host PC programs the configuration registers with
valid values the host LED will automatically turn off.
