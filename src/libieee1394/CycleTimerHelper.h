/**
 * Implements a DLL based mechanism to track the cycle timer
 * register of the Ieee1394Service pointed to by the 'parent'.
 *
 * A DLL mechanism is performance-wise better suited, since it
 * does not require an OS call. Hence we run a thread to update
 * the DLL at regular time intervals, and then use the DLL to
 * generate a cycle timer estimate for the parent to pass on
 * to it's clients.
 *
 * The idea is to make reading the cycle timer real-time safe,
 * which isn't (necessarily)the case for the direct raw1394 call,
 * since it's a kernel call that could block (although the current
 * implementation is RT safe).
 *
 * This also allows us to run on systems not having the
 * raw1394_read_cycle_timer kernel call. We can always do a normal
 * read of our own cycle timer register, but that's not very accurate.
 * The accuracy is improved by this DLL mechanism. Still not as good
 * as when using the raw1394_read_cycle_timer call, but anyway.
 *
 * On the long run this code will also allow us to map system time
 * on to 1394 time for the current host controller, hence enabling
 * different clock domains to operate together.
