FreeBoB version 1.0.0
=====================

This project aims to provide a free driver implemenation for the BeBoB
platform.  The BeBoB is used in many available IEEE 1394 based break-out 
boxes.

Dependencies
------------

To build libfreebob you need several libraries. For all libraries a
version is provided which is a 'known good' version.  The first few
libraries it seems it is not necessary that the version must
match. The chances that it works also with an older versions are good:

alsa        (>= 1.0.0)
libxml2     (>= 2.6.0)
libpthread  (>= 2.3.5)

These libraries here should be at least the version listed:

libraw1394  (>= 1.2.1),  http://www.linux1394.org
libiec61883 (>= 1.0.0),  http://www.linux1394.org
libavc1394  (>= 0.5.3),  http://sourceforge.net/projects/libavc1394

Currently only the jackd audio server is supported.

jackd (>= 0.102.5), http://jackaudio.org

Optionally, but recommended is that you install qjackctl:

qjackctl (>= 0.2.20.10), http://sourceforge.net/projects/qjackctl

How to build
------------

Building the code is straight forward if PKG_CONFIG_PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and INCLUDE_PATH is correctly set up.

E.g on my system I have installed libraw1394, libiec61883 and libavc1394
under /usr/local:

$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

If you want to build the release version you can do following:

$ ./configure
$ make 
$ make install

If you want some debug information (because something seems not
to work correctly) you can try do following (not CVS checkout):

$ ./configure --enable-debug
$ make
$ make install

NOTE: In order to build jackd with freebob support, you have 
to install libfreebob before you build jackd.


Running jackd
-------------

The easiest way to run this is using qjackctl. There are only minor 
differences with the other backends, however you should change some
of the default values:
- The 'interface' field should contain only a number. This number is
  the port number of the IEEE1394 host controller the audio device
  is connected to. For most people this will be '0', but if you have
  multiple controllers, you have to change this number.
- The 'Input channels' and 'Output channels' fields indicate if the
  backend should provide capture and/or playback channels. If you set
  these to 0, no channels are created. In order to enable capture and/or
  playback, you have to set them to a nonzero value.
- It is recommended to change the 'periods/buffer' field to 3, especially
  if you use low period sizes (=< 128)
- It is recommended to raise the RT priority to 70.

In order to get it running from the command line, you need to provide some 
arguments to jackd.

Run 

$ jackd -d freebob --help

to see the backend options. You can easily figure out how to set them using
the remarks given above (for qjackctl).

For the other aspects of jackd usage, consult the jackd documentation.

Here is a sample session (without realtime support enabled):

In case of problems
-------------------

Under the tests directory there is a test program. You should first
try to run this.

If you don't have installed libfreebob then you can adapt your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:../src/.libs

Then you can try running the program without having to install it.

With the release version you see something like this:

wagi@cruxam:~/src/libfreebob/tests$ ./test-freebob discover
verbose level = 0
Using freebob library version: libfreebob 0.9.0

  port = 2, devices_on_bus = 1
  get info for device = 0, node = 1

If you don't get this, check if you have multiple host controllers, and 
use the -p parameter to specify them. If you get any error messages, the 
best way to help us figure out what the problem might be is to build the 
debug version (./configure --enable-debug). You can then rerun the test
application and send us its output.
