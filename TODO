- xml output is a bit wierd -> generate a more generic output
- correct string encoding
- position information of channel in stream: bebob indexes from 1 
  but iec61883 expects it from 0. see todo in avdevice.cpp
- check all std::cout and std:cerr if they couldn't be replaced with 
  the DebugModule's methods. The idea is to have a more consistant
  code.
