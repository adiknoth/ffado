FreeBob
=======

This is work in progress.  Do not expect anything working.  Especially at this
point of time of the project.

This project aims to provide a free driver implemenation for the BeBob
platform.  The BeBob is used in many avaible IEEE 1394 based break out boxes.

IEEE 1394 protocols are rather complex and confusing.  This is the first
approach to master those protocols and get streaming working with a
BeBob plattform.  

Dependencies
------------

You need following libraries in order to build FreeBob:

libraw1394 (>= 0.10.0), http://www.linux1394.org
libiec61883, http://www.linux1394.org
libavc1394, http://sourceforge.net/projects/libavc1394

How to build
------------

Building the code is straight forward if PKG_CONFIG_PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and INCLUDE_PATH is correctly set up.

$ autoreconf -f -i -s
$ ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
$ make
